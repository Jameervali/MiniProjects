This is a simple modern signup/signin page .
This is done using Html,Css,javascript.
This can be connected to backend using node.js and mangoose .
This mini project is more like a generic template for signup/sign in pages.
This works for valid emails only .That is emails with extension of '@...' .
By connecting to server side we can successfully signup to the page and our credentials are saved in database.
I have done this miniproject as a habit of programming.
